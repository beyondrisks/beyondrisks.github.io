### TL;DR
In this demonstration, we harnessed the power of the ChatGPT API to create a SAS to Python translator. Through strategic manipulation of prompts, we engineered a seamless flow to facilitate the conversion process. Leveraging the [FLASK](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web framework, we developed a user-friendly website interface. This platform accepts SAS code input, visually presents the data flow, and subsequently generates a corresponding Python script.
